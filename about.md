Hi, I'm Gil, a PhD Candidate in Applied Physics in the <a href="https://mabuchilab.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Mabuchi Lab</a> at Stanford University. I'm generally interested in model reduction techniques, simulation methods, and quantum optics. You can see some of my work <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gil_Tabak/publications" target="_blank">here</a>, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you would like to chat or collaborate on a project. Also be sure to check out my <a href="https://www.github.com/tabakg" target="_blank">code</a> and other thinking on this personal site.
