If you fish for a fish  
you may just get dish  
but it may or may not  
be the dish that you wished  
for, but anyway who keeps score  
what matters is being hungry no more.  
With this meal that's a steal  
it's one hell of a deal  
and there isn't a bill  
can it even be real?  

once your appetite subsides  
and your attitude resides  
in a better place  
you may find yourself  
at home at last  
in the comfort of your bed  
with your phone under your red  
blanket browsing facebook  
looking at what's been cooked  
relaxed at last.
