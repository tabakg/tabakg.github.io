What is the best way to rinse a dish?

Let's make a few assumptions so we can answer the question.
Let's suppose there is some contaminant in the dish that starts at some
concentration $c_0$ as a portion of the initial volume $V_0$
of the dish contents.
Suppose we can do one of two things at a time: continuously add water at a rate $r$,
or pour out the contents of the dish. However, we can't empty the dish entirely,
instead leaving a volume $V_\min$ in the container. Emptying the dish takes takes a
time $t$.

We want the dish to contain a volume of no more than $V_\text{end}$ of the
contaminant. What is the best strategy for rinsing?
