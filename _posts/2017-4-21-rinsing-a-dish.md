What is the best way to rinse a dish?

Let's make a few assumptions so we can answer the question.
Let's suppose there is some contaminant in the dish that starts at some
concentration <p>$c_0$<p> as a portion of the initial volume <p>$V_0$<p>
of the dish contents.
Suppose we can do one of two things at a time: continuously add water at a rate <p>$r$<p>,
or pour out the contents of the dish. However, we can't empty the dish entirely,
instead leaving a volume <p>$V_\min$<p> in the container. Emptying the dish takes takes a
time <p>$t$<p>.

We want the dish to contain a volume of no more than <p>$V_\text{end}$<p> of the
contaminant. What is the best strategy for rinsing?
